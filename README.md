# simple_drop-down-menu

this is a simple drop down menu which gets activated when the cursor is hovered on the item under which the menu is. this is useful since it saves the design of several other 
webpages for user guiding thus reducing the effort and providing a more satisfactory interaction between the user and the website

in the code i have used differnt types of selectors such as the element and the class. i have used the class instead of id because an id is suppossed to be unique i.e it 
should be given to only one element where as multiple elements can have the same class. as the work progresses on this project the page will be made fully responsive and for
doing that the class selector will be more handy than the id selector.

alsi i have made a lot of se of element selectors to show how to access different elements at different levels/hierarchy.
the page is semi responsive at its current stage since a lot of absolute units have been used compared to regular units.
